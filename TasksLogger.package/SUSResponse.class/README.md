# SUSResponse
Answer to SUS standard Usability Form.

Users will have ranked each of the 10 templates questions from 1 to 5, based on their level of agreement.

- For each of the odd numbered questions, subtract 1 from the score.
- For each of the even numbered questions, subtract their value from 5.
- Take these new values which you have found, and add up the total score. Then multiply this by 2.5.

The result of all these tricky calculations is that you now have your score out of 100. This is NOT a percentage, but it is a clear way of seeing your score.
